<h2>Data we collect</h2><p>Rangle collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our products. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you choose to send error reports to Rangle to help diagnose a performance.</p>
<p>You have choices about personal data we collect. Personal data does not include data that is tied solely to your organization and not to an individual. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide personal data that is necessary to provide a product or feature, you may not be able to use that product or feature.</p>
<p>The data we collect depends on the products and features you use and how the product is configured on your device. But, our collection is generally limited  to usage data.</p>
<h2>Usage data</h2><p>We collect data about how you and your devices interact with Rangle and our products. For example, we may collect:</p>
<p>Product use data. We collect data about the features you use, how often you use them, and how you use them.</p>
<p>Device data. We collect data about your device and the network you use to connect to our products. This could include data about the operating systems and other software installed on your device, including version information. It also includes IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), and regional and language settings.</p>
<p>Error reports and performance data. We collect data about the performance of the products and any problems you experience with them. This data helps us improve our products and services, to diagnose problems in the products you use, and provide solutions. Depending on your product and settings, error reports can include data such as the type or severity of the problem, details of the software or hardware related to an error, contents of files you were using when an error occurred, and data about other software on your device.</p>
<h2>How we use data</h2><p>Rangle uses the data we collect to operate our business, to provide product functionalities and experiences, and improve the products and services we offer. This includes operating the products, maintaining and improving the performance of the products and services, including developing new features, and providing support. Rangle does not use this data for advertising purposes.</p>
<h3>Examples uses</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Providing the products.</strong> We use data to provide our products&#39; functionalities and user experiences that enhance productivity. It may also help us personalize your product experience.</li>
<li><strong>Product improvement.</strong> We use data to continually improve our products and services, including adding new features or capabilities, such as using error reports to improve security features, or using usage information to prioritize future feature development.</li>
<li><strong>Business operations.</strong> We use data to develop aggregated analytics and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reasons we share personal data</h2><p>We share your personal data with your consent. For example, we share your information with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you link your product with a service.</p>
<p>In addition, we will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;</li>
<li>Protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;</li>
<li>Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks;</li>
<li>Protect the rights or property of Rangle, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if Rangle, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Rangle goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Rangle may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h2>Cookies and similar Technologies</h2><p>Our products may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. Web beacons and cookies could be from Rangle or third-party service providers.</p>
<h2>Security of personal data</h2><p>Rangle is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access. When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.</p>
<h2>Where we store and process personal data</h2><p>Personal data collected by Rangle may be stored and processed in your region, in Canada or in any other country where Rangle or its service providers maintain facilities. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
<h2>Our retention of personal data</h2><p>Rangle retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill any essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations.</p>
<h2>Collection of data from children</h2><p>When a Rangle product collects a user&#39;s age, it will either block users under 13 or will ask them to provide consent from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under 13 to provide more data than is necessary to provide the product.</p>
<p>Once parental consent is granted, the child&#39;s data treated like any other user. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children&#39;s personal data.</p>
<h2>Changes to this privacy statement</h2><p>We will update this privacy statement when necessary to reflect customer feedback and changes in our products. When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the &quot;last updated&quot; date at the top of the statement and describe the changes in the Change Log section of this privacy statement. If there are material changes to the statement or in how Rangle will use your personal data, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Rangle is protecting your information.</p>
